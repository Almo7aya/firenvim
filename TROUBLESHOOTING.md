# Troubleshooting Firenvim

If you're having issues with Firenvim, here are the following steps you can take in order to check if everything is correctly set up on your side:

## Make sure the neovim plugin is installed

Run neovim without any arguments and then try to run the following line:
```
call firenvim#install(0)
```

- If this results in `Installed native matifest for ${browser}` being printed, the firenvim plugin is correctly installed in neovim and you can move on to the next troubleshooting step.

- If this results in `No config detected for ${browser}` and `${browser}` is the browser you want to use firenvim with, this might be because your browser configuration files are in a non-standard directory. If this is the case, force-install firenvim by running `call firenvim#install(1)` and read the documentation about native manifest location for [firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Manifest_location) or [chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging#native-messaging-host-location) in order to figure out where you should copy the native manifest generated by `firenvim#install(1)`.

- If this results in `Unknown function: firenvim#install` being printed, then firenvim is not correctly installed in neovim and this is likely a configuration error from your side. Check your configuration again.

- If this results in `nvim version >= 0.4.0 required. Aborting`, you know what to do :).

## Make sure the firenvim script has been created

Running `call firenvim#install(0)` should have created a shell or batch script in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/firenvim` (on linux/osx, this usually is `$HOME/.local/share/firenvim`, on windows it's `%APPDATA%\firenvim`). Make sure that the script exists and that it is executable. Try running it in a shell, like this:
```sh
echo 'abcde{}' | $XDG_DATA_HOME/firenvim/firenvim
```
This should print a json object the content of which is the current version of the firenvim neovim plugin. If it doesn't, please open a new github issue.

## Make sure the firenvim native manifest has been created

Running `call firenvim#install(0)` should also have created a file named `firenvim.json` in your browser's configuration directory. Make sure it exists:

- On Linux:
    * For Firefox: `$HOME/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts`
    * For Chrome: `$HOME/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`
    * For Chromium: `$HOME/.config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts/`
- On OSX:
    * For Firefox: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts`
    * For Chrome: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts`
    * For Chromium: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Chromium/NativeMessagingHosts`
- On Windows: in `%APPDATA%\firenvim` and check that the following registry keys exist and point to the native manifest:
    * For Firefox: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\firenvim`
    * For Chrome/Chromium: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\firenvim`

Also check the content of this json file to make sure that the `path` key points to the firenvim script you checked the existence of in the previous step. If the json file is missing or if the `path` attribute is wrong, please open a new github issue.

## Make sure the browser extension can communicate with neovim

In your browser, open the background console. This requires the following steps:

- On Firefox:
    * Go to `about:debugging`
    * Select `This Firefox` in the left column.
    * Find firenvim.
    * Click on the `inspect` button.
    * If the console already contains messages, empty it by clicking on the trash icon.
- On Chrome/ium:
    * Go to `chrome://extensions`
    * Enable Developer mode (the button is in the top right corner)
    * Find firenvim.
    * Click on the `backround page` link.
    * If the console already contains messages, empty by pressing `<C-l>`.

Then, navigate to a page with a textarea (I really like `http://txti.es` for this). Open the content console (`<CS-I>` on both firefox and chrome/ium) and focus the textarea. This should result in messages being printed in the console. If it doesn't, try clicking on the Firenvim icon next to the urlbar. If no messages are logged there either, try clicking on the `Reload settings` button.

If none of the messages help you understand what's wrong or if you're not getting any messages, please open a new github issue.

## Make sure firenvim's $PATH is the same as neovim's

Some operating systems (such as OSX) empty your browser's `$PATH`. This could be a problem if you want to use plugins that depend on other executables. In order to check if this is indeed happening, just run `echo $PATH` in your shell and `:!echo $PATH` in firenvim and compare the results. If they're different, this might be the culprit.

In order to fix this, [find the firenvim script](#make-sure-the-firenvim-script-has-been-created) and edit it to manually export the right `$PATH`, e.g.

```diff
 #!/bin/sh
 cd $HOME/.local/share/firenvim
+export PATH="/path/to/somewhere:/path/to/elsewhere:$PATH"
 exec '/usr/bin/nvim' --headless -c 'call firenvim#run()'
```

Please note that this is something you will have to do every time you call `firenvim#install()`.
